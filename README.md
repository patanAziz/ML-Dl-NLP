🎵 Song Recommendation System using ML & NLP
A machine learning-based music recommendation system that suggests songs similar to a given input song. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand song metadata (like lyrics, genres, tags) and Machine Learning models to compute similarity between songs.

📌 Features
Input a song name to get top similar song recommendations

Utilizes NLP techniques for understanding lyrics or metadata

ML-based similarity computation using cosine similarity

🚀 How It Works
Data Preprocessing:

Load song metadata (title, artist, lyrics, genre).

Clean and preprocess text using NLP techniques (lowercase, stopwords removal, lemmatization).

Vectorization:

Convert song descriptions or lyrics to numerical vectors using TF-IDF or sentence-transformers.

Similarity Calculation:

Use Cosine Similarity to find songs most similar to the input.

Recommendation:

Return top N songs based on similarity scores.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

spaCy / NLTK (for NLP)

Sentence-Transformers (optional)

Streamlit (optional UI)

Pickle (for model saving)

EXAMPLE:
>>> recommended_song("Shape of You")
